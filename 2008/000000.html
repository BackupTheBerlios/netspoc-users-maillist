<PRE>I just released Netspoc version 3.1.
It is available at <A HREF="http://prdownload.berlios.de/netspoc/netspoc-3.1.tar.gz">http://prdownload.berlios.de/netspoc/netspoc-3.1.tar.gz</A>

New features:
* Support for negotiated interfaces which dynamically get an IP address 
out of an attached network has been added.
* Support for loopback interfaces which are not attached to any network 
has been added.
* Support for Cisco VPN 3000 devices has been added, but currently isn't 
well documented.

Language:
* Flags for services have been introduced. These flags modify the way in 
which rules are applied to stateless devices or to devices in general. 
As an example, it is now possible to define a rule for FTP traffic which 
permits the data channel only at stateless devices, but not at stateful 
devices.
* New &quot;automatic&quot; groups have been introduced which allow to define new 
groups from other groups or from the topology. Examples: The group of 
networks which contain an already defined group of hosts. The group of 
interfaces of a network. The group of security domains of an area.
* Automatic groups of interfaces can be restricted to interfaces of 
managed devices.
* The concept of &quot;auto&quot; interfaces has been extended. 
interface:router.[back] denotes the interface(s) which are on the 
opposite side in respect to the other object in a rule. 
interface:router.[auto], which denotes the interface(s) on the same 
side, has been renamed to interface:router.[front]. But [auto] is still 
supported for compatibility.
* A simple means has been introduced to define an area which contains 
the whole topology.
* New syntax has been defined to individually select a secondary IP 
address of an interface in a rule.
* network:[local] denotes the network connected to an interface.
* A feature from version 3.0 to individually define an interface as full 
or secondary filter has been removed. This feature wasn't used anywhere, 
but prevented a run-time optimization.
* The following language elements are no longer supported, because they 
can better be expressed by newly introduced automatic groups: &quot;every:x&quot;, 
&quot;any:[all]&quot;, &quot;interface:[managed].x&quot;, &quot;interface:[all].x&quot;

Other:
* Pathrestrictions are added automatically for each set of virtual 
interfaces now.
* Enhanced command generation for Cisco PIX devices with dynamic NAT. If 
multiple networks are mapped to a single dynamic pool, now a single 
&quot;global&quot; command is generated, which is referenced by multiple &quot;nat&quot; 
commands.
* Added a check for &quot;transient any rules&quot;.
 If we have a security domain any_A and two rules &quot;permit XX -&gt; any_A&quot; 
and &quot;permit any_A -&gt; YY&quot; then this implies a rule &quot;permit XX -&gt; YY&quot; 
which may not have been wanted. Netspoc now looks for this situation and 
aborts if the implied rule is not explicitly defined.
* Added a check to enforce that different hosts inside a network don't 
have the same IP address.
* Multiple optimizations were done which improve the run-time 
performance for configurations with large rule sets and topologies.
* New command line option &quot;-time_stamps&quot; shows run-time in seconds for 
different compilation steps.

Bug fixes:
* Correctly handle the case were two different loops touch each other 
directly. This occurs if one loop starts at a network A and the other 
one at a router B and A and B are directly connected.
* Added missing &quot;static&quot; entries at pix devices for networks which have 
a dynamic NAT at some other device.
* Fixed a bug where Netspoc aborted if an area was defined by attribute 
&quot;anchor&quot;.
* Fixed some problems with disabled interfaces.
